Dans un autre registre, la publication de spam, de contenu pornographique non désigné comme tel avec un “Content Warning” (CW) mènent aussi à une exclusion du serveur. Cette instance Mastodon se veut inclusive et bienveillante, ainsi nous bannirons sans prévenir et sans regret. Les comptes bannis ne sont plus accessibles depuis notre instance, vous ne pouvez plus voir leur contenu ni les suivre.\r\nNous encourageons nos utilisateur-ice-s à utiliser la fonction de rapport (“Report”) pour nous faire part du contenu et/ou des comptes allant à l’encontre de nos règles.
