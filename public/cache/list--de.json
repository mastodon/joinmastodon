Female sexual pleasure deserves far more attention than it currently does - not only by men, but also by women themselves. Inanna is not for dating or hookups. However, you are encouraged to use Inanna to find out what your partner likes 🐘 We are fully aware of the sensitivity here, hence we chose Mastodon to ensure anonymity and no secret data abuse. So, feel safe to speak up.\r\n\r\n坦诚的女性性愉悦社区 — 有趣，有用\r\n\r\n欢迎来到伊南娜！我们想帮助女性获得更棒的性体验 — 并不是每次都必须达到高潮，而是每次都令人愉快，都令人激动。\r\n\r\n如何使用伊南娜？如果你是女性：在这里分享你最销魂的体验；向别人学习新招式；用“转嘟”功能标记你最喜欢的帖子，然后把你的用户名告诉你的伴侣 ;)\r\n\r\n如果你是男性：阅读并学习（不用谢）；参与讨论，比如提问，或分享你的体验；谦虚并心态开放。\r\n\r\n为何创造伊南娜？女性性愉悦这一命题，目前远远未受到应得的重视 — 不仅男性，女性亦重视不足。伊南娜并非约会或约炮网站。不过欢迎通过伊南娜发现你伴侣的性趣 🐘 鉴于话题敏感，我们特意选择了长毛象，从而保证你的匿名，且保证我们无法偷偷滥用你的数据。请放心的发言讨论。","topic":"Pleasure","languages":["zh","en","de"],"other_languages_accepted":true,"federates_with":null,"prohibited_content":["nudity_nocw"],"categories":["activism","adult","lgbt"]},"thumbnail":"https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/inannamedia/site_uploads/files/000/000/001/original/Mastodon_hero_image_v2.png","thumbnail_proxy":"https://camo.instances.social/8d31756e9eabaed9bf183ca044e7f16049b31e10/68747470733a2f2f73332e65752d63656e7472616c2d312e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f696e616e6e616d656469612f736974655f75706c6f6164732f66696c65732f3030302f3030302f3030312f6f726967696e616c2f4d6173746f646f6e5f6865726f5f696d6167655f76322e706e67","active_users":14},{"id":"58eea2c0463e1078268a96c5","name":"bonn.social","added_at":"2017-04-12T21:57:20.178Z","updated_at":"2018-08-03T13:44:25.710Z","checked_at":"2018-08-03T13:44:25.710Z","uptime":1,"up":true,"dead":false,"version":"2.4.3","ipv6":false,"https_score":100,"https_rank":"A+","obs_score":50,"obs_rank":"C ","users":"198","statuses":"10603","connections":"1763","open_registrations":true,"info":{"short_description":"Bonn.social ist eine Mastodon-Instanz für Bonn und alle, die Bonn lieben.
