            If you are a server owner, and your server passes these
            requirements, you can send an e-mail to{" "}
            <span className="font-bold">servers@joinmastodon.org</span> with the
            subject &quot;Server submission&quot; to be listed on this website.
            Please include the <strong>domain name</strong>, whether you are a
            private individual or represent an organization, in which country
            the server is legally situated in, and which category would fit it
            best.

            Because our goal is giving new users a smooth and reliable start
            into the decentralized social network of Mastodon rather than simply
            promoting individual servers, we are generally not interested in
            promoting brand new and unproven servers, so the submission should
            not be your primary strategy of growing your community.
