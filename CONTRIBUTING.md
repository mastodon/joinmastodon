# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to the Mastodon project website ü¶£

You may want to contribute in the following ways:

- Finding and reporting bugs
- Translating the site into various languages
- Adding apps

> [!NOTE]
> This is not the correct repository for contributions to the code that runs mastodon.social (ie the Mastodon server run by the code Mastodon team).

## Bug reports

Bug reports and feature suggestions must use descriptive and concise titles, and be submitted to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/mastodon/joinmastodon/issues). Please use the search function to make sure that you are not submitting duplicates, and that a similar report or request has not already been resolved or rejected.

## Translations

You can submit translations for the website via [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/joinmastodon). They are periodically merged into the codebase. See the [README](./README.md) for more information.

## Adding apps

The idea of the third party apps section is to provide a showcase for apps built for the Mastodon platform. Inclusion in the list is not an endorsement, and is also not guaranteed - this is not intended to be an exhaustive list.

In an effort to offer choice but to limit confusion, there are a number of considerations:

- the Mastodon team may not be able to test all apps that are submitted, and do not endorse third party apps simply based on their inclusion on the website. There is no fixed schedule for pull requests to be reviewed - in most cases, other code maintenance tasks have a higher priority.

- Apps should be current and maintained; please submit issues or pull requests to remove Apps that are known to have been deprecated or retired. We will periodically remove apps that appear to no longer be maintained or usable, but feel free to notify us if this happens in error.

- Apps must be _generally available_

  - do not add apps that are only available to a limited set of users (e.g. TestFlight/beta testing)
  - do not add apps that are only available in certain countries (people may click through and find that they are not available for them to install, which may be disappointing)

- Apps that are forks of other apps may in future be labelled as such / filtered in some way. This is to keep the main list at a manageable size for most users to browse and to reduce confusion between similar user experiences.

### Basic process

**Please use clear and concise titles for your pull requests.**

**The smaller the set of changes in the pull request is, the quicker it can be reviewed and merged.** Splitting tasks into multiple smaller pull requests is often preferable. One PR to add an app is preferred.

- fork the repository and create a branch for your app addition

- add the icon (under `public/apps`) and the corresponding information to the file that generates the page (in `data/apps.ts`).

  - images must be PNG format, and _ideally_ at least 512x512 pixels square (although some existing icons are smaller than this).

- if the app is multiplatform, only one icon should appear in the All apps view. This means that you _must_ add `hidden_from_all: true,` to all except one of the entries in the list. We suggest that if the app has a web version, that should be the version that is not hidden (as it will be clickable directly from the All apps list)

- please ensure that the correct value for `paid: true|false` is specified for the app entry.

- submit a PR to the `mastodon/joinmastodon` repository, and please be patient üëçüèªÔ∏è
